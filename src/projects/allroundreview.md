<span class="dropcap">A</span>ll Round Review is an advanced multi-author tech review blog with onboard writers and editors built with next.js for fast performant pre-rendered webpages.

Authors and administrators can create, publish, modify and delete posts and articles.

There's also a draft page which contains an author's ongoing work, if an author is creating a post, and they stop typing into the editor for 50secs without publishing the article, all content will be save automatically to avoid content lost.

And there's more! Check it out live below
