All Round review is an advanced tech review blog with onboard writers and editors built with <b>next.js</b> for fast performant pre-rendered and SEO friendly webpages. Authors and administrators can create, draft, publish, republish, unpublish, modify, upload media, delete articles and much more!.

I have also Implemented different components that make writing and reading fun â€” such as; Auto saving editor content while an author is working, custom dynamic box-cards and action buttons in articles, an image gallery (a collection of images that can be enlarged in a slide at any section of an article), review and product cards. All can be added to an article!
