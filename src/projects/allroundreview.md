## Update

All Round Review has gone from a side project to a live production application used and accessed by several people, for that I was requested to remove the GitHub link and make the repository private. the links above are for the test version of the application that gives you access to everything so you can get the feel and experience for yourself.

If you have any questions, suggestions, or curiosity about the application you want to know or ask, feel free to reach out to me anytime! â€” Check out the live production version below.
